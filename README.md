# Lensing of standard sirens

Mock catalogues of events used in https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12764. 

For the fiducial scenario, 50 independent realisations of redshifts 
and lensing magnifications {𝑧,𝜇} of the events are made available, together with a short script to plot the data. Each realisation contains 3000 events.

The mock data are relevant for gravitational waves emitted by merging binary neutron stars measured by the **Einstein Telescope**, 
assuming a threshold for the signal-to-noise ratio of **8**, and accompanied by an electromagnetic counterpart.
